# Aura Kingdom server installer

## What is this?
This script allows you to create an Aura Kingdom server based on the releases from [RaGEZONE](http://forum.ragezone.com/f935/). The idea is that you don't have to mess around with changing ips, password settings or hexing of binaries. This tool does all of that for you, all you have to do is selecting what you want to install.

## How to use?
The script is intended for use on debian 11. The command to download and run this script is the following:
```shell
wget --no-check-certificate -nv "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haruka98/ak_oneclick_installer/master/akinstall.sh" -O "akinstall.sh"; chmod 777 "akinstall.sh"; ./akinstall.sh
```
